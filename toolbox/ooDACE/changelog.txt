ooDACE Toolbox Changelog
---------------------------

* 1.4 - public release (3 June 2013)
	+ improved portability of the regression tests across Matlab versions and architectures
	+ added information about run-time and memory requirements to the getting started guide
	+ added symbolic expression support for corrmatern32 and corrmatern52 correlation functions
	+ significantly improved the cokriging hyperparameter optimization
	  * added support for the rho hyperparameter derivative

* 1.3 - public release (1 July 2012)
	+ significantly updated the getting started guide
	  * added new class diagrams and a sequence diagram
	+ added regression test framework (runRegressionTests)
	+ added blind kriging examples (runBlindKrigingExamples)
	+ fixed bug in symbolic expression (getExpression method) of stochastic kriging

* 1.2 - public release (1 April 2012)
	+ renamed blindDACE to ooDACE
	+ fixed bug in regressionFunction()
	+ regressionFunction() now accepts struct instead of cell array

* 1.1 - public release (5 February 2012)
	+ improved cokriging hyperparameter optimization
	+ cokriging is updated (instead of refitted) when new fine data is available,
	  as long as the coarse data stays the same over subsequent calls to the fit() function
