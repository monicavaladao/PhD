Version 0.5 (in development)
^^^^^^^^^^^
- Trust regions for equality constrained problems.


Version 0.4.5 (December 2011)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The hanging_chain example in the 'example' directory has been
  corrected.

Version 0.4.4 (February 2009)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Bugs corrected: the unconstrained quasi-Newton version with Wolfe
  linesearch was not terminated (Thanks to Xiaohan Ma, for having
  recalled me this!).
- Cosmetic improvements.

Version 0.4.3 (December 2008)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The Hanging Chain example has been added.

Version 0.4.2 (December 2008)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Bugs corrected.
- Cosmetic improvements.

Version 0.4.1 (October 2007)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Cosmetic changes.

Version 0.4 (June 2007)
^^^^^^^^^^^
- Unconstrained problems can now be solved by a quasi-Newton algorithm
  using Wolfe linesearch and the inverse BFGS update formula.
- Important restructuration of the software.


Version 0.3 (March 2007)
^^^^^^^^^^^
- State constraints are accepted, provided there is no inequality
  constraints and the Newton version of the algorithm is used.


Version 0.2 (February 2007)
^^^^^^^^^^^
- Globalization by linesearch, using a merit function.
- Quasi-Newton (BFGS) approximation of the Hessian of the Lagrangian.


Version 0.1 (December 2006)
^^^^^^^^^^^
- The local algorithms (equality and inequality constraints) using
  second derivatives.
