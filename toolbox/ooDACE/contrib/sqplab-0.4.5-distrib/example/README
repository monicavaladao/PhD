Hanging chain example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The example 'hanging_chain' is provided to show how 'sqplab' can be
used to solve an equality and inequality constrained problem. The
problem consists in finding the static equilibrium position of a chain
made of rigid bars. This problem is further explained and discussed in
the book whose reference is given below.

To run the example:
- launch matlab
- enter 'hanging_chain' in the execution window.

The output of SQPlab should then be close to that in
'hanging_chain.res' and the generated figure should be close to the one
in 'hanging_chain.eps'.
