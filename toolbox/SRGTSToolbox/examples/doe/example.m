% This is just an example of how to use the SURROGATES Toolbox
% capabilities.
%
% It illustrates the use of the following functions:
%     - srgtsDOEFullFactorial.m
%     - srgtsDOELHS.m
%     - srgtsDOEOLHS.m
%     - srgtsDOETPLHS.m
%     - srgtsDOESubSample.m
%
% All parameters used in this example just illustrates how modify the
% default ones. They do not reflect any specific study in parameter
% selection.
