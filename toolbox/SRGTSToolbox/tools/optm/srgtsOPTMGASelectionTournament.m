function [parents, parentsScores] = srgtsOPTMGASelectionTournament(population,scores,NbTournaments)
%Function srgtsOPTMGASelectionTournament performs the GA tournament selection 
%operator. This operator performs a pair-wise ranking selection. Thus, for 
%example:
%
%     [PARENTS, PARENTSSCORES, NBPARENTS] = srgtsOPTMGASelectionTournament(OLDPOP,OLDSCORES,OPTIONS):
%     creates a new population with the selected individuals. OPTIONS is the
%     number of tournaments (which is equal the number of parents selected,
%     NBPARENTS).
%
%One can use this function out of the simpleOptimizer, even though it can not
%make any sense. Therefore, it is possible to manipulate the related option
%through the simpleOptimset, and then use this function inside "simpleOptimizer.m".
%
%Example: Create a SimpleToolBox option structure specifying the selection 
%function and also some related parameters.
%
%     options = simpleOptimset('GASelectionFcn', @srgtsOPTMGASelectionTournament, ...
%                              'GASelectionFcnOpts', 5);
