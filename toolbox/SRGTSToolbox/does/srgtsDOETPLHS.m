function LHS = srgtsDOETPLHS(nPoints, nDV, seed)
%Function srgtsDOETPLHS generates Latin hypercube design by using the
%Translational Propagation algorithm (TPA). The objective is obtaining
%optimal (or near optimal) Latin hypercube designs without using formal
%optimization. This procedure requires minimal computational effort with
%results virtually provided in real time. The algorithm exploits patterns
%of point locations for optimal Latin hypercube designs based on the
%PHIp-criterion (a variant of the maximum distance criterion). Small
%building blocks (called SEEDs), consisting of one or more points each, are
%used to recreate these patterns by simple translation in the hyperspace.
%Research conducted during development of the TPA found that (i) the
%distribution of PHIp tends to lower values as the dimensionality is
%increased; and (ii) the Latin hypercube designs, obtained via TPA,
%represent an attractive alternative to the optimum Latin hypercube designs
%up to medium dimensions. It is concluded that for up to six dimensions (no
%matter the point density) the proposed Latin hypercube designs provide
%computationally inexpensive estimates of the optimal Latin hypercube
%design.
%Each row of the design represents one run (or sample). Design variables
%are normalized so that the hypercube points take values between 0 and 1.
%Thus, for example:
%
%     P = srgtsDOETPLHS(NPOINTS, NDV): generates an NPOINTS-by-NDV
%     matrix. NPOINTS is the number of points and NDV is the number of
%     variables. The seed design used in this case is a single point placed
%     at the origin of the design space.
%
%     P = srgtsDOETPLHS(NPOINTS, NDV, SEED): generates an NPOINTS-by-NDV
%     matrix. NPOINTS is the number of points and NDV is the number of
%     variables. SEED is the basic Latin hypercube design used to build the
%     ELHD. No normalization is needed for a 1-by-NDV SEED.
%
%     P = srgtsDOETPLHS(NPOINTS, NDV, NTRIALS): generates an NPOINTS-by-NDV
%     matrix. NPOINTS is the number of points and NDV is the number of
%     variables. The algorithm is run NTRIALS times, with seed size varying
%     from 1 to NTRIALS. P is the best design found in terms of the PHIp
%     criterion. The PHIp criterion is a measure of how well spread the
%     points of the sample are over the design space. See
%     srgtsDOEPHIpCriterion for more details about the PHIp calculation.
%
%Example:
%     % create a 14x2 design.
%     NPOINTS = 14;
%     NDV     = 2;
%
%     P = srgtsDOETPLHS(NPOINTS, NDV)
