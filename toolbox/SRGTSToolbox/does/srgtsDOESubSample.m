function [SubDOE, SubDOEIdx, RemDOE, RemDOEIdx] = srgtsDOESubSample(DOE,npoints,varargin)
%Function srgtsDOESubSample selects points from a user-defined design
%according to a specific optimality criterion.
% 
% THIS FUNCTION USES THE NATIVE MATLAB FUNCTION: candexch!
% 
%Each row of the design represents one point (or sample). Design variables
%are normalized so that the hypercube points take values between 0 and 1.
%Thus, for example:
%
%     P = srgtsDOESubSample(DOE, NPOINTS): generates an NPOINTS-by-NDV
%     matrix. NPOINTS is the number of points and NDV is the number of
%     variables. It uses the 'MinMax' criterion running for 1000
%     iterations.
%
%     P = srgtsDOESubSample(DOE, NPOINTS, CRITERION, CRITOPT): generates an
%     NPOINTS-by-NDV matrix. NPOINTS is the number of points and NDV is the
%     number of variables. It uses the criterion specified by CRITERION and
%     CRITOPT. In this case:
%          * CRITERION: is a string that defines the method for point
%          selection, and
%          * CRITOPT: is the option used during the point selection.
%
%     CRITERION can be one of the following:
%          * 'MaxMin': select points according to the maximization of the
%          minimum distance between points. In this case, CRITOPT is the
%          number of iterations to be performed.
%          * 'Doptimal': which select points according to the D-optimal
%          criterion, in which designs are obtained by the maximization of
%          the determinant D = |X'X|. This optimality criterion results in
%          minimizing the generalized variance of the parameter estimates
%          for a pre-specified model. As a result, the 'optimality' of a
%          given D-optimal design is model dependent (i.e. it depends on
%          the order of the polynomial response surface). In this case,
%          CRITOPT is a vector in which the first element represents the
%          degree of the polynomial response surface used to model the
%          data; and the second element represents the number of iterations
%          to be performed. (NOT AVAILABLE IN OCTAVE!)
%
%     [P, IDX] = srgtsDOESubSample(...): also returns a vector that
%     informs the indexes of each point of P (i.e., the position of each
%     point of P in the input design, DOE).
%
%     [P, IDX, REMP] = srgtsDOESubSample(...): also returns the remaining
%     points of the input design (i.e., those not used in P).
%
%     [P, IDX, REMP, REMPIDX] = srgtsDOESubSample(...): also returns the
%     vector of indexes of the remaining points of the input design (i.e.,
%     the position of each point of REMP in the input design, DOE).
%
%Example:
%     % create pre-defined design (200x2).
%     NLHPOINTS = 200;
%     NDV       = 2;
%     LHD       = lhsdesign(NLHPOINTS, NDV); % it can be any user-defined design
%
%     % select a design with 16 points usign 'MaxMin'.
%     NPOINTS     = 16;
%     NITERATIONS = 1000;
%     P01         = srgtsDOESubSample(LHD, NPOINTS, 'MaxMin', NITERATIONS)
