function d = srgtsDOEMinDistCriterion(X, varargin)
%Function srgtsDOEMinDistCriterion calculates the minimum distance, dmin,
%criterion for a given design of experiment. The minimum distance criterion
%is a measure of how well spread the points of the sample are over the
%design space:
% 
% dmin = min(D)
%         i
% 
% where D is the matrix of Euclidean distances between two points of the
% design. The general inter-point distance between any point pair can be
% expressed as follows:
% 
%           nv
% d_ij = ( sum |x_ik - x_jk|^(2) )^(1/2)
%          k=1
% 
% where nv is the number of variables.
% 
%Thus, for example:
%
%     dmin = srgtsDOEMinDistCriterion(X): returns the dmin value for the
%     design given in X.
%
%Example:
%     % create Latin hypercube design.
%     NDV     = 2;
%     NPOINTS = 12;
%     LHD = lhsdesign(NPOINTS, NDV)
% 
%     LHD =
% 
%     0.5268    0.8588
%     0.6035    0.3069
%     0.1047    0.5041
%     0.7173    0.1638
%     0.4454    0.2134
%     0.0691    0.7182
%     0.2745    0.4362
%     0.4140    0.9337
%     0.8103    0.4011
%     0.9128    0.0425
%     0.2419    0.6295
%     0.9314    0.7795
% 
%     dmin = srgtsDOEMinDistCriterion(LHD)
% 
%     dmin =
% 
%     0.1354
%     
%Results may change from run to run because of the random nature of the
%Latin hypercube design.
