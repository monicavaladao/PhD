function [xstar] = srgtsScaleVariable(x, fromDomain, toDomain)
%Function srgtsScaleVariable scales a vector from a specific domain to
%another. Thus, for example:
%
%     xstar = srgtsScaleVariable(x, FROMDOMAIN, TODOMAIN): maps the vector
%     x from the FROMDOMAIN domain to the TODOMAIN domain.
%
%Example:
%     physicalspace = [-5  0;  % lower bound
%                      10 15]; % upper bound
%
%     normalizedspace = [0  0; % lower bound
%                        1  1]; % upper bound
%
%     % create points in the normalized space
%     P = [0.0  0.0
%          0.5  0.5
%          1.0  1.0];
%
%     % map P to the physical space
%     X = srgtsScaleVariable(P, normalizedspace, physicalspace)
%
%     X =
% 
%    -5.0000         0
%     2.5000    7.5000
%    10.0000   15.0000
% 
%     % create points in the physical space
%     X = [2.5  0.0
%          -5   7.5
%          10   15];
%
%     % map X to the normalized space
%     P = srgtsScaleVariable(X, physicalspace, normalizedspace)
% 
%     P =
% 
%     0.5000         0
%     0.0000    0.5000
%     1.0000    1.0000
