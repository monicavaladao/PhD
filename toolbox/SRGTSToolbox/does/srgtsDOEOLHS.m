function LHS = srgtsDOEOLHS(npoints, ndv, method, varargin)
%Function srgtsDOEOLHS generates optimized Latin hypercube samples. It uses
%either the enhanced stochastic evolutionary algorithm (ESEA) proposed by
%Jin et al. (2005) or the genetic algorithm (GA) proposed by Bates et al.
%(2004) to solve the optimization problem.
%Each row of the design represents one run (or sample). Design variables
%are normalized so that the hypercube points take values between 0 and 1.
%Thus, for example:
%
%     P = srgtsDOEOLHS(NPOINTS, NDV, METHOD): generates an NPOINTS-by-NDV
%     matrix. NPOINTS is the number of points and NDV is the number of
%     variables. METHOD is a string that defines the optimization
%     algorithm:
%         - 'ESEA' uses the enhanced stochastic evolutionary algorithm
%           proposed by Jin et al. (2005)
%         - 'GA' uses the genetic algorithm (GA) proposed by Bates et al.
%           (2004)
%
%     P = srgtsDOEOLHS(NPOINTS, NDV, 'ESEA', MAXITER, MAXSTALLITER):
%     creates the Latin hypercube design with the ESEA set to run for
%     MAXITER iterations with at most MAXSTALLITER iterations without
%     improvement.
%
%     P = srgtsDOEOLHS(NPOINTS, NDV, 'GA', MAXITER, MAXSTALLITER, POPSIZE):
%     creates the Latin hypercube design with the GA set to run for
%     MAXITER iterations with at most MAXSTALLITER iterations without
%     improvement using POPSIZE individuals.
%
%Example:
%     % create a 14x2 design.
%     NPOINTS = 14;
%     NDV     = 2;
%
%     P = srgtsDOEOLHS(NPOINTS, NDV, 'ESEA')
% 
%     P =

%     0.6923    0.6154
%     0.3077    0.4615
%     0.0769    0.3077
%     0.1538    1.0000

%     0.4615    0.1538
%     0.7692         0
%
% 
%OBSERVATION:
%In both ESEA and GA strategies, the obtained experimental design might
%change from one run to another due to the random nature of the heuristic
%optimization techniques used to solve the optimization problem.
