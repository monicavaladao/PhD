function LH = srgtsDOELHS(npoints, ndv, niterations)
%Function srgtsDOELHS generates a Latin hypercube sample using random
%search. Function srgtsDOELHS is especially suitable for very large
%designs, when the native MATLAB function run out of memory. This may
%depend on the MATLAB version and on the configuration of the machine used.
%This function is most useful after you try to run 'lhsdesign' without
%success.Each row of the design represents one point (or sample). Design
%variables are normalized so that the hypercube points take values between
%0 and 1. Thus, for example:
%
%     P = srgtsDOELHS(NPOINTS, NDV, NITERATIONS): generates an
%     NPOINTS-by-NDV matrix. NPOINTS is the number of points and NDV is the
%     number of variables. It uses NITERATIONS iterations of the maximum
%     inter-distance algorithm.
%
%Example:
%     % create a 1024x10 design.
%     NPOINTS     = 1024;
%     NDV         = 10;
%     NITERATIONS = 5;
%
%     P = srgtsDOELHS(NPOINTS, NDV, NITERATIONS); % it may take a while
